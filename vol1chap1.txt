The day after we reluctantly agreed to help with that whole mess. It's now lunchtime.

In the emergency stairwell of the old school building, I leaned against the landing railing and pierced a straw into a milk carton.

"Sorry for calling you two here so suddenly."

Sitting on the steps across from me, unwrapping his bento, are Mitsuki Ayano and Hiroto Sakurai.

"Nukumizu, you said you had something important to talk about, right? What's up?"

Ayano asked, popping a quail egg wrapped in bacon into his mouth.

His parents love cooking, so his bento is always colorful and varied.

"I'm ready. Just tell us whatever it is."

Sakurai-kun said with a serene smile, picking up some simmered fuki with his chopsticks. [TL: A slightly bitter vegetable that is mainly used for herbal purposes.]

He has recently started making bento and even makes one for the student council president every day. Just get married already.

"Thanks. Actually, I need to talk to you two about a new first-year we're looking after in the Literature Club."

...Well, there's no point in hiding anything now.

I took a deep breath and began explaining what had happened, step by step.

After listening to everything, Ayano put down his chopsticks and tilted his head.

"...Is it really okay to tell us all that?'

"It's not something to spread around, but I got her permission."

I didn't check the exact limits of that permission, but it should be fine. Probably.

"I had heard a bit about it, but I didn't know the full story."

Sakurai-kun said, his usual slightly tired smile on his face as he stared at the meat-wrapped burdock root on his chopsticks.

"She said she wanted to come to terms with her feelings, but the person involved is her brother-in-law. It's not like she can confess, get rejected, and be done with it. We don't know what she might do."

Ayano nodded and picked up his chopsticks again.

"She has already had a run-in with the police. If something like that happens again, suspension won't be enough."

Sakurai-kun looked up at the sky thoughtfully upon receiving Ayano's gaze.

"I'm not a teacher, so I don't know for sure, but…I've never heard of someone getting suspended twice in such a short period."

Never having heard of it basically means it doesn't happen.

I finished my milk and turned to face them both.

"So, I need your advice. I ended up agreeing to help her, but I wanted to avoid anything illegal. But I'm a guy, so I don't really understand girls' feelings. I was hoping you two could help come up with a plan that she would be satisfied with."

Silence. The two of them exchanged puzzled looks before hesitantly speaking.

"...Nukumizu, we're guys too, you know."

"Yeah, wouldn't it be better to ask the girls in the Literature Club?"

I knew they would say that. I gave them a serious look.

"Listen, I've realized something in the past year- the girls in the Literature Club don't count as girls at all."

The two of them looked like they had something to say but then closed their mouths again.

"If anything, you two actually have more insight and could be more helpful."

After a moment of thought, Ayano nodded with a complex expression.

"I can subtly ask some acquaintances, but don't expect too much."

"I can ask around for opinions too, but I can't say I'm confident about understanding girls' feelings."

That's already enough. Being in the Literature Club really messes with your sense of what is normal or not.

"You should hurry up and eat, too, Nukumizu-kun. The bell is about to ring."

Sakurai-kun said that as he wrapped up his finished bento box.

Oh, it's this late already? I should eat. Yanami might devour my lunch if I save it until the next break…

Listening to the conversation between the two who had already finished their meals, I opened the bag of curry bread.

Come to think of it, the girls they know are-

A familiar face flashed through my mind.

I forcibly pushed that thought to the back of my mind and took a bite of the curry bread.

*

The club room after school is filled with a tense atmosphere.

Yanami and Komari are silently staring at the envelopes laid out on the table by Riko Shiratama.

There are three large envelopes, big enough to hold notebooks or A4 paper.

The words <Pine>, <Bamboo>, and <Plum> are written in large letters on each envelope.

"I came up with three plans last night, Prez. Please choose whichever you like."

She urged me across the table.

Forget about whether I like these plans. I'm not actually the type that likes to make choices…

"Come on, Prez. Make your choice."

"H-Hurry up and p-pick one, Prez."

Yanami and Komari pressured me from both sides. These girls only call me Prez at times like this.

After much hesitation, I picked up the envelope labeled <Bamboo>. It was a typical Japanese choice, valuing the middle ground.

"Uh, real estate flyers…?"

Inside the envelope is a flyer for a rental property in the city.

The location is in the mountains north of Futagawa Station, It's a solitary house.

"I found a lovely property in Futagawa. There aren't any houses nearby, and bonus points for having a basement-"

I put the flyer back into the envelope before she could finish explaining.

"...Can I see the other envelopes?"

"Prez, don't you want me to explain the plans?"

I don't. I hastily picked up the envelope labeled <Pine> in half desperation.

Travel brochure this time.

The cover featured a large photo of a stylish overwater bungalow.

"Uh, what's this…?"

"Onee-chan and Tanaka-sensei are going to Tahiti for their honeymoon. They are always so busy, so they wanted to relax for once."

Yanami snatched the brochure from me before Shiratama-san could finish.

"Wow, that looks amazing! A romantic night under the stars-"

With a dreamy look in her eyes, Yanami's gaze quickly dimmed as she stared at the pamphlet.

"...I see, after the wedding comes the honeymoon, right, I get it…"

God, there she goes again.

I signaled to Komari, who then placed a Hoshiume candy in Yanami's mouth. [TL: Dried plums with brown sugar.]

With a lifeless look, Yanami slowly chewed the candy as I gently retrieved the pamphlet from her hand.

"So, what kind of plan is it?"

"Onee-chan and I look just the same from behind. If I rent the cottage next to theirs, I can sneak in and switch places with her at night-"

I quickly slipped the pamphlet back into the envelope.

The only envelope left is the one labeled <Plum>. I prayed as I opened it.

Inside are some documents and catalogs.

"...Is this the wedding venue brochure?"

"Yes, it's onee-chan's wedding materials. I copied everything: brochures, estimates, the seating chart for the day, and so on."

Shiratama-san's hands paused over the thick stack of papers.

There's a photo of a pure white wedding dress, notable for its long train.

"...I want to wear this and take pictures in the chapel."

She shook her head slightly and turned the photo over.

"Onee-chan got to do everything first, so I wanted to have something, just one first for myself. Maybe that's when I could call Tanaka-sensei my onii-chan."

As I remained silent, struggling to find the right words, Shiratama-san began to organize the wedding documents.

"It's impossible, right? Let's just go with Plan Pine or Bamboo-"

Bang! I leaned forward and pressed down on the papers.

"We're going with this one!"

"Hold up, Nukumizu-kun!?"

Yanami was flustered. Think about it. The other options are Pine and Bamboo, you know?

Shiratama-san blinked and looked up at me with wide eyes.

"The dress will only arrive just before the wedding, so taking pictures in it will be difficult, right?"

"Sure, taking photos in that exact dress might be tough, but...what if we took photos in a different dress as a stand-in?"

"In the chapel?"

"In the chapel."

"...One more thing."

What? Uh, is that not enough?

Shiratama-san leaned in closer as I hesitated.

"...For example, what if we took a two-shot photo with Tanaka-sensei?"

"In the chapel?"

"In the chapel."

Shiratama-san nodded eagerly.

That's impossible.

Taking a two-shot photo in the chapel without him noticing is just asking for trouble.

Shiratama-san must have realized it was nearly impossible, even though she was the one who suggested it.

Her eyes shifted to the other two envelopes-

"...Let's do it."

Shiratama-san's eyes sparkled at my words.

"Then, let's get started-"

Before she could finish her sentence, Yanami and Komari grabbed me by the arms and dragged me to the corner of the room.

"Eh? What are you two doing?"

"Are you seriously going to help her!? I'm not going to be an accessory to a crime!"

"I-If you want to d-die, die a-alone!"

My my, these two are overreacting. We're just talking about taking a photo.

Sneaking into the wedding venue on the day, tricking the groom into taking a photo-

"...Wait, that's illegal?"

Yanami and Komari nodded vigorously.

Yanami sighed and released me, turning to Shiratama.

"Shiratama-chan, I understand how you feel, but this isn't going to be easy. Renting a dress alone costs a lot of money, and you need a professional photographer. It would cost a fortune."

"Yes, that's why I prepared this."

Shiratama-san placed a card on the table.

It's a cash card from Toyohashi Shinkin Bank, known locally as Toyoshin.

"I've been saving all the money I received for celebrations and New Year's gifts over the past 15 years. I have a million yen."

"Wut!?" (x3)

Shiratama-san pushed the card toward us as we stood frozen.

"I entrust this to you. Use it freely for this plan."

No way we can accept such a large sum of money.

I stepped forward under the pressure of Yanami and Komari's gazes.

"You're right. We'll need money for the plan. But instead of giving us the card, you should pay directly for what we need each time."

"Yes, that's right, Shiratama-chan. Travel expenses, food, and living costs all add up."

Yeah, that's right, but can you stop molesting the cash card?

"But this is the least I can do for dragging you all into this…"

Shiratama-san said in a faint voice, looking down.

If that's how she feels, then we definitely can't accept it. I shook my head.

"We're your senpais, Shiratama-san. That's enough reason to help."

Komari nodded vigorously.

"...Thank you all so much."

Shiratama-san wiped the tears that had welled up.

I scratched my cheek, feeling a bit embarrassed.

"That said, it's going to be tough to outsmart your sister and take a two-shot photo."

We need to read the materials thoroughly and come up with a detailed plan-

...Wait, are we really going through with this?

Komari seems somewhat on board, and Yanami probably just wants a fat check.

"Last time, the security guards found me quickly because I didn't know the building's layout well. We'll need to scout the inside properly first-"

Shiratama-san's eyes sparkled as she began outlining the plan.

"Uh, Shiratama-san. Could I talk to you for a moment?"

"Yes, Prez?"

Her eyes shimmered as she looked at me.

Well, how should I say this…?

Instead of outright rejecting her idea, I should acknowledge her proposal while gently pointing out the concerns and finding a soft landing-

Just as I was thinking, voices and footsteps echoed from the hallway.

Then, with a loud bang, the club room door flew open.

"Excuse me!"

The sudden arrival is the student council president, Hibari Hokobaru.

After giving us a polite bow, she marched up to Shiratama-san.

"You're Riko Shiratama-kun, correct?"

"Ah, yes, are you the student council president…?"

Shiratama-san froze in her chair.

With her usual expression, Prez dramatically swept her hair back.

"Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Hokobaru, the student council president. I've heard everything, Riko-kun!"

"Huh!? About what?"

Sakurai-kun entered the room, out of breath.

"I…told you…to wait, Hiba-nee…"

After catching his breath, Sakurai-kun walked over to Prez.

"Don't shout and startle everything like that. Come on, we should go. We're in the way here."

"Hold on, Hiroto. We're not done here."

Prez ignored Sakurai-kun's attempt to stop her and placed her hands on Shiratama-san's shoulders.

"Eh? Uh…"

"A secret love that defies societal norms! The determination to strike back even while hiding such feelings! As a fellow woman, I'm deeply moved. I would like to offer my assistance!"

Prez's voice echoed throughout the room. Sakurai-kun looked up at the ceiling, exasperated.

Shiratama-san, who had been frozen in place, timidly opened her mouth.

"Uh, SC Prez, where did you hear about this…?"

"Oh, I heard everything from Hiroto over there. Don't worry. He's like family to me."

Sakurai-kun clasped his hands together and bowed deeply.

…I had a feeling this would happen.

"So, let me get this straight. What I told Prez got passed on to you, SC Prez?"

"Exactly."

…Creak. Hearing this, Shiratama-san slowly turned her stern face toward me.

Oh my, I didn't know Shiratama-san could make such an expression. Huh, I see…

As I wiped the cold sweat with my handkerchief, Yanami stepped forward while chewing on a Hoshiume candy.

"Prez-senpai, what do you mean by offering to help?"

"The more people involved, the better the chances of making a lasting impression."

Prez picked up the wedding venue pamphlet and flipped through it.

"...Hmm, a revenge mission, is it?"

"Huh? Revenge?"

Prez nodded while reading the materials.

"You're planning to infiltrate the wedding venue again and steal the bridal gown, right?"

"Uh, no, we've given up on stealing the bride's dress. Instead, we're planning to secretly take wedding photos with Tanaka-sensei."

"...? Isn't that going to be difficult?"

"Yes, but there's a bit more to it-"

"Prez, are you here!?"

A voice interrupted me- it's Teiara-san.

She strode into the club room after a quick bow.

"Sensei is waiting for you. Today is the meeting for the student council elections."

"Right. Do I need to be there?"

"Of course! Shikiya-senpai is holding things up for you, so please come quickly!"

"Got it. Shiratama-kun, can I borrow these materials for a bit?"

"Ah, yes, I can give you the details."

Teiara-san pulled Prez away from the room.

Just as I breathed a sigh of relief, Teiara-san returned alone, glaring at me.

"Eh? What?"

"Nukumizu-san. You're not trying to make the president do something bad, are you?"

"...Ain't no way."

"Why are you saying it like that?"

Teiara-san narrowed her eyes and stared at my face.

I'm not lying. Prez is the one who's insisting.

"I won't forgive you if you do anything that tarnishes Prez's reputation, Nukumizu-san."

She left with that stern warning.

…Finally, the storm has passed.

Sakurai-kun, who had been left standing awkwardly, turned to us with a pale face.

"Uh, I don't know how to apologize for this..."

Yanami shook her head and offered him a Hoshiume candy.

"Don't worry about it, Sakurai-kun. This is all Nukumizu-kun's fault for having a big mouth, isn't it?"

"Eh, my fault?"

Yanami and Komari nodded in unison. Yeah, I've done goofed up.

And Shiratama-san, she's making a face I've never seen before…

*

I read a message from Prez as I headed toward the school bike parking lot.

I commute by bicycle right now. My parents found out I was biking to school for training in the third term of my first year, so they didn't renew my train pass.

"Another day at school tomorrow..."

Even though tomorrow is a holiday, Prez has summoned the Literature Club to the club room.

By the way, I am the president of the Literature Club. If the club gets disbanded, maybe surviving as a subordinate of the student council wouldn't be so bad...

As I reached the bike parking lot, I noticed a cute figure sitting on the rear rack of my beloved bike.

-It's Shiratama-san. I stopped a distance away from her.

"...Are you still not going home yet?"

"Yes, I forgot something."

Her perfect smile, as usual.

Uh, she must be mad at me for spilling the beans to the student council, right…?

"What's wrong? Aren't you going home?"

"Ah, yeah. I'm going home."

I lowered my head and walked past Shiratama-san-

"Your bike is here, Prez."

"Oh, right. I've been so forgetful lately."

…I got caught trying to walk past her.

Even after unlocking the bike, Shiratama-san didn't move from her cute sitting position.

"Uh, Shiratama-san…?"

"Yes, what is it, Prez?"

Smile, smile, smile. All I could do was muster a forced smile in return.

…Shit. This is totally ruining my dignity as a senpai.

I only talked about it because I was told it was okay to share with the collaborators. I didn't irresponsibly spill any secrets. Yeah, I didn't do anything to apologize for.

"Prez, I'm a bit angry."

"I want to apologize."

However, sometimes, it's important to say sorry sincerely.

As I bowed deeply, Shiratama-san's voice fell upon me from above.

"I trusted you because you are the president, you know?"

"Uh, you said it was okay to talk about it..."

"Of course, it's fine to inform those who are inconvenienced. But who would think the student council would find out?"

Yes, you're right. I couldn't say anything back, so I just kept my head bowed. Shiratama-san couldn't hold back her laughter and started giggling.

"Please lift your head. I'm not really angry."

"But it's true that I told the student council..."

"I just felt a little sulky because I thought it was a secret between us."

Shiratama-san got off the bike rack, clasping her hands into fists in front of her chest.

"Everyone is doing so much for me. I've made up my mind."

"Huh!? But if you do something reckless-"

As I instinctively stepped back, Shiratama-san quickly closed the distance between us.

A sweet scent like milk wafted towards me.

"It was you who lit the fire, Prez."

Her moist eyes are framed by long eyelashes.

A whisper escaped her petite, pink lips.

"...You have to take responsibility."

*

The next morning. Rubbing my sleepy eyes, I sat at a table in the Literature Club room.

Despite it being a holiday, Yanami, Shiratama-san, and I responded to Prez's call.

Standing with arms crossed beside the table, Prez looked around at us.

"Is this everyone? There was one more person here yesterday."

"Komari peeked into the room from the window earlier but then ran away. You can start."

Prez nodded and attached a large piece of paper to the whiteboard she brought.

On it, written in calligraphy, are the words "Riko Shiratama's Revenge Plan Headquarters".

Shiratama-san timidly raised her hand.

"...Uh, what is this 'Revenge Plan' written here?"

"Ahh, I asked my grandmother to write it for me this morning. She's a certified master."

I see. That's why it's so well done. And probably not the answer Shiratama-san was looking for.

Prez unfolded a folding chair and sat down heavily.

"Let's discuss the plan. What are the current goals? How far along are the preparations?"

"Uh…"

Seeing Shiratama-san a bit overwhelmed, I stepped in.

"We've only just set the goal, and nothing else has been decided yet."

Prez nodded and placed a piece of paper on the table.

"Then how about enlisting the help of an expert? I found this yesterday by chance."

It's a handmade flyer that says, "Contact Tsuwabuki Investigation Advisors for your covert investigation needs!"

"Uwah, what's this, Prez-senpai?"

Yanami leaned in while eating her second breakfast rice ball of the morning.

The flyer is filled with words like "confidential", "completely legal", "no basic fees", and "patent pending", all in cheerful fonts.

This is one of those shady indie advertisements you sometimes see posted on utility poles.

"Hey, Prez. Isn't this a bit sketchy?"

"Don't worry. It's just a Tsuwabuki student doing independent research. They are trustworthy."

Someone in our school is doing these things…?

I could think of one person, but no, it couldn't be.

Prez glanced at the clock on the wall as I was feeling uneasy.

"It's about time. I've already arranged a consultation."

"Huh?"

Right on cue, there was a knock at the door.

The door slowly opened, revealing a familiar girl.

She bowed with her forehead shining.

"I'm Chihaya Asagumo from Tsuwabuki Investigation Advisors, and this is-"

From behind her, another familiar girl stepped forward.

"I'm Kaju Nukumizu, her assistant. We'll do our best."

The Literature Club girls stared at me intently.

No, this isn't my fault, right…? Yeah, probably not.

*

Asagumo-san from Tsuwabuki Investigation Advisors wrote the words "Information" and "Preparation" on the whiteboard in large letters and circled them.

"The first step is gathering information and preparing in advance. And-"

She wrote "Goal" in even larger letters.

"It's crucial to share the goal within the team. Riko-san, when is the wedding?"

"Ah, yes, it's next Saturday."

The wedding is in nine days, the first weekend after the Golden Week holiday.

Asagumo-san nodded and began writing the dates from today to the wedding day in sequence on the whiteboard.

"We have a fixed deadline, so instead of managing progress with milestones, let's manage it with tasks. First, we'll share information and identify necessary tasks. The Golden Week holiday starts the day after tomorrow, so let's use it to finish our preparations."

So we're spending this year's Golden Week holiday preparing for a crime. Cool…

After finishing the calendar on the whiteboard, Asagumo-san turned to us.

"The goal is clear: we need to take wedding photos of Tanaka-sensei and Riko-san without getting caught on the wedding day."

...The problem is that condition. The path to success is narrow, with many hurdles to overcome.

Seeing everyone fall silent, I raised my hand slightly.

"Uh, we might need to be flexible with the goal depending on the situation."

"Even if we need to adjust the goal, gathering information is still necessary. Let's first review the current situation."

At Asagumo-san's signal, Kaju turned on the projector she had prepared.

Displayed on the white wall is an aerial photo of the city map.

The wedding venue is prominently located at a spot close to downtown.

It's near Mukaiyamaoikecho Park and adjacent to the prefectural Kirinoki High School.

"The venue is secluded from the outside, so we can only see the interior from the photos on their website. Riko-san, do you know the inside layout?"

Shiratama-san shook her head silently.

"Understanding the internal layout is our top priority. I'll hand it over to my assistant for that."

As Asagumo-san stepped aside, Kaju took the stage.

"I did a site inspection this morning."

"Eh, when? How come I didn't know?"

Kaju made my breakfast and prepared my clothes, after all.

She winked at me and continued.

"The manager was at the entrance, so I had a chance to speak with him. This venue hosts only two weddings per day and offers exclusive garden weddings."

Kaju operated her smartphone and projected photos onto the screen.

"The venue is enclosed by walls to ensure privacy, with the main entrance being the only way in. On the day of the event, only someone related to Riko-san will be able to enter."

...I see. This won't be easy. Since it's a private event, we can't pretend to be guests of another party.

"But Kaju, didn't it seem suspicious when you spoke with the venue staff?"

"No, he was a gentleman. He even gave me his business card."

-Gentleman. So, he's a guy, huh?  Well, gender doesn't really matter.

"Let me see the business card. Kaju, you didn't give them your contact information, did you?"

As I tried to stand up, Yanami pulled me back into my chair.

"Sit down, Nukumizu-kun. Imouto-chan, what was your impression aside from the investigation?"

"Yes, it has a wonderful atmosphere! Kaju would love to have my wedding there someday!"

Kaju clasped her hands in front of her chest, eyes sparkling, while looking straight at me.

Prez, who had been quietly listening, crossed her legs and looked thoughtful.

"Hmm, so we need to investigate the venue first. Kaju-kun, you must have some ideas, right?"

Kaju nodded with a smile.

"Yes, there's a tour this Saturday. A spot opened up due to a cancellation, so I've already signed us up."

Wow, she's well-prepared. Signing up for a venue tour-

"Wait, isn't it weird to participate without a wedding planned? And we're high school students."

Asagumo-san smiled as if it was nothing.

"Ara, we just need to have our wedding there in the future. Now, let's decide who will attend the tour."

Asagumo-san slowly looked around at us.

"Yanami-san, why are you standing up?"

"Eh? Well, it needs to be someone who looks mature, right?"

"Yeah, that's true. That's why you should sit down."

I thought it over as I got her back onto the chair.

A high school student who could pass for an adult in appearance and behavior is hard to find-

"Hmm? What's wrong, everyone?"

Everyone's gaze is drawn to Prez. Asagumo-san approached her.

"How about you, Prez? Could you attend the tour?"

"I would love to help, but I have a memorial service on Saturday. It's my great-grandfather's 50th anniversary. I can't really miss that."

Prez's eyes gleamed. She seems like the type who enjoys attending memorial services…

"I guess that can't be helped. Why don't you sit down, Yanami-san?"

This is a problem. Who should we ask if Prez can't go?

Sensing our dilemma, she spoke up.

"Let's ask Shikiya. She can be trusted to keep things confidential."

Shikiya-san, huh…? She looks mature, but can we rely on her?

Ignoring my concerns, Kaju wrote Shikiya-san's name on the whiteboard.

Asagumo-san tilted her head cutely while placing a finger on her chin.

"So, who should be her partner? Does anyone have someone in mind?"

Hmm, someone who can stand next to Shikiya-san without looking out of place- ah!

"How about Ayano? He looks mature, and if he wears a suit-"

"No."

Asagumo-san interrupted me firmly.

"Eh? But he would-"

"No, he wouldn't."

She smiled sweetly at me, though her eyes were not smiling.

"He has an unavoidable appointment that day. Nukumizu-san, I can make up a memorial service for you if you want-"

"Okay, let's not use Ayano! Prez, do you have anyone suitable?"

I hurriedly shifted the conversation, and Prez shrugged helplessly.

"I don't want to involve too many outsiders. It would be best if we could keep it within the Literature Club or the student council."

Tamaka-senpai- no, his girlfriend won't keep her mouth shut, and it would be a disaster if something went wrong.

Yanami muttered with a sullen expression as I racked my brain.

"...Then why don't you do it, Nukumizu-kun?"

"Huh?"

"If you have so many complaints, you should be able to do it perfectly, right?"

Yanami glared at me while opening her third breakfast sandwich in 15 minutes.

"Wait, there's no way I can pull off pretending to be an adult."

"...No, that doesn't seem like a bad idea."

"Huh?"

Prez stood up and patted my shoulder.

"You're quite tall, and with the right outfit and makeup, it could work. What does everyone else think?"

The first to raise a hand was Kaju.

"I would love to see onii-sama in a suit! I could even be his partner, and we could get married on the spot-"

No, that's ridiculous.

I stood up and gently guided the excited Kaju to sit in the corner of the room.

"Kaju, you have plans with friends that day, right? Remember, you're going to the amusement park in Hamamatsu."

"...I don't."

Kaju averted her gaze. I pulled out my phone.

"We share a calendar. You can't hide things from me."

"Ugh, but Kaju really wants to have a wedding with onii-sama..."

We're not having a wedding in the first place.

"Then it's settled. Nukumizu-san will be the one to attend."

Without giving me a chance to object, Asagumo-san wrote my name on the whiteboard and circled it.

Asagumo-san looked at the now-filled board and nodded in satisfaction.

"Alright, let's start preparing for the tour on Saturday. I'll provide the necessary equipment for the investigation, but can everyone prepare their outfits for the day?"

…Outfit? I guess a suit would be fine.

I could borrow my dad's suit, but I'm still just a high school student…

"Uh, are you sure I-"

Prez clapped her hands together before I could finish.

"Alright, we have a lot to do! Riko-kun, are you set with the wedding dress?"

"Ah, yes. I found a good one second-hand..."

Shiratama-san cut herself off and suddenly stood up.

"Hey, SC Prez!"

"What's wrong, Riko-kun?"

"Why…are you doing all of this for me?"

For a moment, the president was at a loss for words as Shiratama-san approached her.

"SC Prez, your exams are coming up, and you're in charge of the student council. You shouldn't be doing this! Unlike us, you have too much to lose!"

In front of us, who have nothing to lose, Prez stood up with a self-deprecating smile.

"I told you. I was moved as a fellow woman. Even I've had my heart burned by unrequited love."

"But we'll be in big trouble if we get caught, right?"

"Then we'll just have to pull it off. I'm looking forward to seeing you in a wedding dress."

Prez spoke confidently as she brushed Shiratama-san's hair with her fingertips.

*

The next day after school. I'm heading to the infirmary to give a report to Konuki-sensei.

Not that I want to, but she might show up in the club room if I ignore this for too long…

As I approached the central building where the infirmary is located, I saw Komari coming out of the library.

Speaking of which, she ran off the moment she saw Prez yesterday.

I started walking towards her to give her a piece of my mind when a guy coming out of the library called her.

That's definitely a third-year librarian. He handed a book to Komari, who looked like a frightened raccoon. I sighed softly.

She can barely talk to girls, so having a conversation with a guy is basically impossible, let alone a senpai.

…Well, there's no other way. I'll be the translator.

As I quickened my pace, I saw Komari receiving the book from that senpai and thanking him.

Huh, so she can talk to boys…

In the past, Komari would freeze and wait for someone to "defrost" her.

Feeling slightly redundant, I stood there watching as Komari, with her head down, walked toward me.

She almost walked past me before noticing and stopping.

"Ueh…? W-What are you doing h-here?"

"Oh, just heading to the infirmary."

I glanced over Komari's head at the library door. That senpai has already returned inside.

"What were you talking about with the librarian?"

"T-The materials I ordered have a-arrived."

Hmm, I see. The thick book Komari's holding must be the one.

…Oops, I need to hurry. Konuki-sensei might wander out of the infirmary.

After a brief greeting, I started walking again, with Komari falling into step beside me.

"Wait, are you going this way too?"

"I-It doesn't matter which way. W-We'll end up at the s-same place, anyway."

It doesn't seem that way to me, but if she says so…

"By the way, Komari, about yesterday-"

"W-What are you p-planning to do?"

Komari cut me off, glancing up at me sharply.

"What do you mean? You ran away from the meeting where we were supposed to decide that."

"T-That's why I-I'm asking if that is even o-okay to do."

…Nope, we'll be in big trouble if we get caught.

Her eyes, peeking out from her bangs, were filled with worry.

"It will be okay. We have Prez with us."

I forced a smile and patted Komari on the head.

"Una!?"

She let out a grunt and jumped back.

Shit! I did it out of habit because she's just as tall as Kaju.

"Sorry! It's just that your height was perfect for it."

Komari, blushing and trembling, backed away slowly.

"Uhh, Komari?"

"...D-Dummy."

Komari muttered and then ran off.

...I've done it now. She'll probably look at me like I'm garbage for a while.

As I recalled the sensation of patting her head, I thought to myself.

Please take better care of your hair, Komari.

*

Freed from Konuki-sensei, I took a deep breath in the twilight of the courtyard.

...I'm very tired. Don't even ask me for the details. I'm extremely tired.

I once again marveled at the patience of Amanatsu-sensei and Shiratama-san's sister for remaining friends with her.

As I stood there, feeling the wind-

Chirp, chirp, chirp…

I heard the call of a bird from somewhere.

It's not a particularly beautiful sound, but it has a soothing quality.

Though I couldn't see it, the sound seemed to come from the bushes in the courtyard.

For a moment, I considered looking for the bird but quickly decided against it.

Just hearing the voice was more calming. The distance felt just right.

In the quiet courtyard after school, I closed my eyes, surrounded by the sound of the birds and the rustling leaves. It's as if my heart, dirtied by the events in the infirmary, is being cleansed. Oh, is that a tufted titmouse…?

As I listened intently, I felt as if I was standing in an autumn meadow.

I could almost smell the pleasant scent of hay carried by the breeze, and I slowly opened my eyes.

Looking around, I saw a man in a suit standing quietly about 2 meters away.

It's Tanaka-sensei, Shiratama-san's sister's fiance.

…He's not observing me, right? No, he just stood there, lost in thought, as the wind blew by.

It's my first time seeing him outside of class since the weekend at the shopping mall.

As I hesitated whether to leave or not, Tanaka-sensei seemed to notice me. He looked slightly surprised.

"Oh, Nukumizu-kun. What are you doing here?"

"Just thinking about some things. What about you, sensei?"

"I heard a bird singing and just stopped. Maybe there's a nightingale in the bushes."

Wait, that's a nightingale?

Noticing my interest, Tanaka-sensei added more details.

"Usually, they're up in the mountains this time of year, so this might be a particularly laid-back one."

"That does give a sense of familiarity."

"Not showing itself is also quite elegant, isn't it?"

"Yeah, I get it."

We stood there, listening to the bird's song. After a while, Tanaka-sensei hesitated before speaking.

"About the other day..."

"Ah, yes."

Tensed up, I waited, and Tanaka-sensei finally spoke after much hesitation.

"...I'm sorry for the interruption."

It was such a mundane statement that I felt a bit deflated.

"No, it's alright. By the way, how has onee-san been since then?"

"You mean Minori-san? She was quite surprised, as was I."

He tried to laugh it off but ended up coughing.

"Should I get you some water?"

"No, I'm alright now…"

We both smiled wryly in this awkward atmosphere.

"Your wedding is next week, right? You must be busy."

"Yeah, I'm just wandering around since I can't seem to stay calm."

He watched my reaction for a moment before speaking again as if resigned.

"Nukumizu-kun, how much has Riko-chan told you?"

"I've heard about her suspension and her sister."

Tanaka-sensei nodded and stood close to me.

"...Riko-chan has recently grown quite distant. She doesn't seem to approve of me marrying her sister."

Without responding, I listened as Tanaka-sensei continued, almost talking to himself.

"We've always been like siblings, and now I'm marrying her beloved sister. It's natural for her to feel conflicted."

"...Well, yeah, that would be complicated, especially during her teenage years."

I tried to brush off the conversation lightly, but something about it stuck with me, compelling me to say more.

"...I think she just wants to be left alone for a while."

I said, feeling my thoughts take shape.

"We're still in high school, so when relationships with parents or siblings change, it's like the world is shifting under our feet. It's a huge deal."


-Honestly, I can't fully sympathize with Shiratama-san's actions. I don't understand it at all.


"To Riko-san, her sister is the person who always sees her first. And you've been like a kind older brother from the neighborhood, practically family. Now, both of those relationships are changing simultaneously. It's only natural for her to feel unstable."


-But I can sense what is driving her.


I smiled at Tanaka-sensei with a facade similar to Shiratama-san's usual smile.

"So, sensei, you should just stay strong and steady as her brother."

Tanaka-sensei nodded deeply as he listened to me.

"...Yeah, I'll just make Riko-chan even more anxious if I don't stay calm myself."

He nodded again, looking at me with a bit of surprise.

"Thank you. You're quite mature for your age."

"Uh, no, I'm just being cheeky. Sorry."

"Not at all. Riko-chan is lucky to have someone like you as her boyfriend."

Tanaka-sensei seemed to be mumbling to himself than to me. He stared out at the courtyard, lost in thought.

Listening to the birds, I recalled Shiratama-san's smile that concealed her true feelings.

…She never has a chance from the start.

Of course, she didn't. She's fifteen years younger, a girl he's known since she was a child, and his fiancee's sister.

There's no way he could see her as a romantic interest.

It's not even about winning or losing.

Tanaka-sensei is honest and good-natured. He cares for Riko Shiratama as if she's his real sister.

-And yet, I feel a tinge of anger.

This man isn't to blame in any way. He's just a bit insensitive.

He hasn't noticed the feelings that have always been there.

But at this moment, I decided to side with Shiratama-san.


No particular reason.

It's just that I'm also going through my teenage years, if I have to give one.

*

Golden Week Day 1. The five-day holiday began with a cloudless sky and perfect weather.

I stood in front of the wedding venue, nervously adjusting my tie.

I came here to attend the tour dressed in a suit borrowed from my parents' closet.

…Can I really pull this off?

Playing the role of an engaged, soon-to-be-married working adult for the first time seems an impossible task.

The hair gel I used felt cold and uncomfortable, making me even more uneasy.

As I stood there, paralyzed by fear, a white hand reached out and tightened my tie.

"...Your…tie. Fix it…properly."

It's Shikiya-san. She's playing the role of my fiancee.

She's wearing a black, elegant dress, with her long hair pinned up with a floral accessory on one side.

"Sorry, I'm just a bit nervous."

I peeked over Shikiya-san's shoulder to get a glimpse of the venue.

It's a house surrounded by a wall with a luxurious tiled exterior.

The entrance, with its white and brown color scheme, has a chic design that gives little away about the interior.

Subtly glancing around, I noticed two figures moving in the tall grass at the edge of the large shared parking lot.

It's Asagumo-san, holding a laptop with an earpiece on her face, and Yanami, wielding an antenna that looks like a bat.

Several businesses share the parking lot, so it's not unusual to see people, but they are real conspicuous.

"Shikiya-senpai, are they going to be alright?"

"...They will be…fine. Have…faith…in…them…"

"Ah, please wait-"

Before I could protest, Shikiya-san took my arm and led me through the entrance.

The entrance hall is spacious, with high ceilings that give it a sense of openness beyond what I had expected from the outside.

Ahead is a counter, where a friendly staff member greeted us with a warm smile.

I composed myself and deliberately lowered my voice.

"...Excuse me. I'm Shimbashi. I have a reservation."

The staff member, dressed in a uniform, glanced at a tablet in their hand.

"Kazuhiko Shimbashi-san and Yumeko Yoshida-san, correct? Please proceed up the stairs over there."

That's right. Today, I'm Kazuhiko Shimbashi, an 18-year-old new working adult about to get married.

And the one gently swaying next to me is Yumeko Yoshida. She works at a flower shop and is my 20-year-old fiancee.

Yumeko, who was absentmindedly looking around, suddenly rested her head on my shoulder. She smells so nice. I wish time would stop right here.

"Where do we…give the…wedding gifts…?"

"No, we're just on a tour today. There's no ceremony."

…This girl didn't listen to our explanation at all.

We left the reception and headed toward the back stairs before she could say anything else.

"What did Prez tell you, senpai?"

"Formal…language, not…allowed…"

Ahh, right, it is weird to use formal language since we're engaged.

"Yume…ko, what did you hear from Hokobaru-san?"

"Something like…I'm having a…wedding. That's the…impression I got…"

The impression she got is very wrong.

Shikiya-san stared intently at the side of my face as I pondered the difficulty of proper communication.

"What- what's wrong? Why are you staring at me?"

"Talking with you… casually…feels new…"

Shikiya-san started playing with my hair, looking amused.

"Hey, stop that- please stop."

"Are you…embarrassed…?"

Huh, was Shikiya-san always like this?

An irritated voice reached my ears as I thought about that.


"Hello!? We can hear everything over here, you know?"


Yanami's voice cut through the earpiece. They were supposed to guide us, but it seems more likely they would just be a hindrance.

"If you don't want to hear it- hey, Yumeko, stop it already."


"Hey!? What are you two even-"


I switched off the earphone and stepped into the large room where the information session was being held.

...By the way, I left Shiratama-san behind. She has a history, after all.

*

-Now, let's rewind a bit. Two hours ago, in the Literature Club room.

Yanami and Asagumo-san, seeing me in my suit, exchanged a glance and nodded with complicated expressions. Please just speak up if you two have something to say.

Shiratama-san looked me over thoroughly, then clasped her hands in front of her with a smile.

"You look great, Prez. It's true that men look 30% better in suits."

Thanks, but I know you're lying. I think I've started to understand Shiratama-san a bit better recently.

Next to me, looking all grown-up, Shikiya-san's in her dress smelled of nice perfume.

Asagumo-san, who has a cooling strip on her forehead, by the way, placed something on the table.

There's a single wireless earphone in front of me.

"Please put this earphone in your ear, Nukumizu-san. I'll give you instructions."

"This will transmit my voice?"

"Yes. It has a built-in microphone so that we can hear you too."

In front of Shikiya-san is a hair ornament with a floral motif.

Shikiya-san picked it up curiously.

"What is…this…?"

"It has an omnidirectional camera embedded in it. Senpai, please wear this hair ornament."

So I'll be the ears, and Shikiya-san will be the eyes.

Shiratama-san, who had been looking around restlessly, raised her hand slightly.

"Uh, what about me...?"

"Riko-san, it's best if you don't show up at the venue until the day of the ceremony. Sorry, but please stand by."

The information session starts at 10 AM. After the general explanation, there will be individual consultation time.

...And this is the critical point. It's impossible for us high school students to pretend to be adults convincingly.

Thorough preparation is necessary to make the impossible possible.

Asagumo-san wrote down the setup on the whiteboard in bullet points.

The story is that Shikiya-san and I need to have a quick wedding as working adults due to unavoidable circumstances.

Addresses, phone numbers, workplaces, parents' profiles, budget, wedding plans…

Asagumo-san finished breaking and cleared her throat.

"We don't have much time during the weekdays, so this long weekend is crucial."

"Wait, but don't you have plans, Asagumo-san? Like a date with Ayano?"

"...He's in a study camp at cram school this long weekend."

The light on Asagumo-san's forehead seems to be fading away.

"He said he would stay silent on purpose and try to beat me in the next test. I really don't need that kind of surprise. I really don't."

Dense as usual, Ayano.

When I looked to my side, I saw Shikiya-san staring intently at the hair ornament.

"Uh, Shikiya-senpai. How much do you know about the current situation?"

"I think…I heard everything…from Hokobaru."

I don't trust her completely, but if she says she's fine, then she's probably fine.

Indeed, I wouldn't be fit to be the Literature Club president if I worry about things like this.

*

Today's tour, which started off like that, was going smoothly for the most part.

We managed to get through the individual consultations successfully. Now, we are walking down the hallway with the "recommended plan" that has been prepared for us, mingling with the other participants.

"I would like fireworks both at the beginning and the end, but I wonder if the budget will allow it. Yumeko, did any options catch your eye?"

"I…want to break…a sake barrel…" [TL: It's a ceremony called "Kagami-biraki" that wishes for health and well-being at times of celebration and new beginnings.]

"Sounds good. Let's talk about it next time."

We are really getting into it, thanks to the detailed explanation from our coordinator. The only problem is that neither the wedding nor the partner actually existed.

As I was discussing the details of the wedding with Shikiya-san…


"All I've been hearing is unrelated talk! What happened to the mission!? Are you a canary that forgot how to sing!?"


…Someone just has to ruin the mood.

I subtly covered my mouth and responded to that someone.

"We're about to start the venue tour. Yanami-san, make sure you're watching the footage and giving proper instructions."

"Excuse me, this is Asagumo. The image is quite shaky. Could you adjust it a bit?"

Now it's Asagumo-san. You know, we're not professionals. It's hard to-

"Is there…a problem…?"

Shikiya-san tilted her head quizzically.

...Oh, right, the camera is attached to Shikiya-san's hair ornament.

"Please bear with it. It's a feature."

I ended the call and followed the guide outside the building.

We stepped into a spacious garden wedding venue. It's covered in grass with sofa sets around.

The garden is surrounded by walls taller than me, blocking any outside view.

And there stands the chapel.

On the day of the ceremony, Shiratama-san and everyone will sneak in there and take pictures with Tanaka-sensei.

As I stared at the building, the coordinator who had interviewed us earlier approached.

"Would you like a tour?"

"Eh? Really?"

"Of course. Please, follow me."

We followed the guide, crossing the bridge over the waterway.

Shikiya-san, who had been staring at the grass, caught up to me.

"Are we…playing bride…and groom here…?"

What? That sounds really fun, but not now.

"We're just taking a look at the chapel. Yumeko, can you...stand up straight for a bit?"

"Then I'll... hold onto you..."

"Eek!"

Shikiya-san wrapped her hand around my arm.

The pleasant scent of her perfume and the indescribable softness pressed against my arm-


"Ahem! Ahem!"


Yanami's exaggerated throat clearing came through the earphone. Shut the hell up…

Following the guide, we stepped into the chapel.

Inside, a straight aisle stretches to the back, with benches lined up on both sides.

At the very back of the chapel, outside a large window, a small waterfall flowed like a curtain of water.

Large windows on the side walls also allowed soft light to filter in, creating a fantastical atmosphere.

The ceiling, dimly lit by indirect lighting, has a slowly spinning ceiling fan, adding a gentle motion to the solemn, serene space. It's pretty calming if I say so myself.

Arm in arm with Shikiya-san, I walked down the aisle- wait, this is supposed to be the role of the bride's father, isn't it?

At the end stands the groom, who's going to marry Yumeko Yoshida, the 20-year-old flower shop worker. Unforgivable.

As we reached the back of the chapel, fueled by righteous indignation, I realized one crucial fact.


-There's nowhere to hide.


The benches for the attendees have open backs, giving a sense of openness, and the walls are smooth with no protrusions to block the view.

Even if we managed to get Tanaka-sensei in here, how would Shiratama-san approach him?


"Nukumizu-san, is there any furniture or spaces where you can hide?"


Asagumo-san's serious voice came through, perhaps realizing the situation.

"Even if you say that…"

There's no audio equipment or shelves in the chapel. Probably to maintain the ambiance, all the unappealing machinery was hidden from view.

There's nowhere to hide in this room- no, there's one.

At the front of the chapel, there's a single lectern-like stand. I think it's called a pulpit…

I took the mobile camera, aka Shikiya-san, and approached the pulpit.

It's a simple wooden stand with a hollow back.

It's not large, but it might be enough to hide from view from the front.

Using my palm, I discreetly measured the size and then moved away from the pulpit to avoid suspicion.

Then, I checked the surrounding dimensions using my steps.

"Alright, Yumeko, shall we go?"

Shikiya-san tilted her head confusedly at my words.

"Are we not…playing bride and groom…?"

"No, we're in public-"

When I glanced over, I saw the coordinator standing by the entrance, silently smiling as they stepped out.

Wait, what kind of thoughtful gesture is that?

As I fidgeted, Shikiya-san grabbed my hand and faced me in front of the pulpit.

"What do we…do next…?"

"Uh, the priest will be there, and then we'll exchange rings and vow eternal love or not-"

"And then…after that…?"

Huh? After that? Once the ring exchange and vows are done, the next thing is…

I gulped.

"Next would be the wedding kiss or something-"


"What are you two doing!? I can hear everything, you know!?"


Yanami's loud voice echoed in my ear. I completely forgot about this woman.

"Well, you know, we need to get the feel of the real thing. Simulation is important."


"A kiss isn't part of the plan, okay!?"


Yeah, it's not. I realized I was somewhat relieved by Yanami's outburst.

Even if it's just pretend, facing Shikiya-san alone like this is nerve-wracking. As I tried to back away, Shikiya-san's pale hand reached out and took my earphone.

"If we kiss, does that mean I'll…become your bride…?"

"Huh!?"

Shikiya-san put my earphone into her chest and leaned closer to me.

The reflection of my face in her white eyes came closer and closer.

"We first need to get married if you want to become a b-bride!"

My voice cracked as I spoke, and Shikiya-san stopped moving closer.

"Filing a marriage registration form is more...essential to becoming a bride than a kiss, wouldn't you say?"

"Marriage…registration…"

After pausing for a moment, Shikiya-san slowly nodded.

"Can't beat…the government…"

With a mysterious sense of understanding, Shikiya-san started to hobble toward the chapel doors.

As I hurried to catch up and walk beside her, Shikiya-san handed the earphone back to me.

Oops, I better stay in contact or Yanami will be a pain. I pushed the earphone back into my ear.

Come to think of it, this was just in Shikiya-san's chest…

Feeling a bit flustered by the thought, I opened the heavy chapel doors to find the coordinator waiting with a beaming smile.

"Ah, sorry to keep you waiting."

"Now, let me guide you to the reception hall. You two will have a tasting of the course menu today."

The coordinator explained, but Yanami's voice cut through my ear.


"How come I didn't know about that!?"


Because I didn't tell you, and please quiet down.

Suppressing a sigh, I ignored Yanami's complaints and followed the coordinator to the reception hall.

I couldn't imagine Yanami maintaining her composure in front of a luxurious meal.

She's never fit to play the role of a fiancee from the start-


"Hey, you there. What are you two doing?"


Suddenly, an old man's voice came through the earphone.

…Looks like they got caught by the security.

Listening to Yanami and Asagumo-san hurriedly try to explain themselves. I finally let out a big sigh.

"...Kazuhiko, is something…wrong…?"

"It's nothing. Don't worry about it, Yumeko."

With another sigh, I took the earphone out and shoved it into my pocket.

*

That evening, I'm sitting at my study desk in my room, talking on my phone.

"I'm really sorry. Hiba-nee must be going overboard, right?"

The person on the other end is Sakurai-kun. He feels bad about Prez forcefully joining our plan and calls almost every night to check-in. I shook my head, knowing he couldn't see me.

"It's okay, really. We'll manage somehow."

"There's no problem so far. She has been helping out, and we do appreciate her a lot."

"But Hiba-nee seems a bit overzealous this time. I'm worried she might be causing trouble."

Compared to Teiara-san, I think Prez's enthusiasm is rather endearing. Talking to the former is like walking through a minefield.

I wrapped my honest feelings in a lot of diplomatic language, and Sakurai-kun finally seemed reassured. We exchanged goodnight wishes and ended the call.

…But that doesn't mean all the trouble is over.

I glanced at the calendar on the wall.

Today marks the start of the five-day Golden Week holiday.

The wedding- our plans execution date is set for the weekend right after the holidays.

"I took a bath first, onii-sama."

Kaju said that as she entered the room in blue pajamas.

Her damp hair spread out over her back as she unwrapped the towel from her head.

"Dry your hair now, Kaju. You'll catch a cold otherwise."

"Then, will you do it for me, onii-sama?"

Kaju plopped down on the bed. My my, there she goes again, being clingy.

I moved behind her to prepare the hairdryer and brought up something that had been on my mind.

"Kaju, are you really that close with Asagumo-san?"

"Yes, she's been very kind to me recently."

I see. She's been very kind to her. That's concerning…

Asagumo-san isn’t a bad person, but she ranks pretty high on the list of people I don't want my sister to follow after. Incidentally, Tsukinoki-senpai holds the top spot right now.

Kaju looked back at me just as I was about to turn on the hairdryer.

"Onii-sama, Kaju wants to see you in your suit, too. How about just the two of us at the next venue-"

"Alright, face forward so I can dry your hair!"

I cut her off by switching on the hairdryer.

I spread Kaju's long hair with my fingers, letting the warm air flow through.

Heat is the enemy of hair. It’s crucial to check the temperature with the back of your hand and feel for any remaining moisture with your fingers, drying it carefully but quickly.

About ten minutes later, I turned off the hairdryer and nodded in satisfaction.

...Perfect. Her hair's texture and shine are impeccable. As I did a final check with my fingers, I noticed something.

"Hey, Kaju, aren't those pajamas mine?"

"They are Kaju's, you know? We got matching pajamas, remember?"

Oh, matching pajamas, huh? Then why did you get the same color...?

Kaju placed a brush in my hand as I pondered about that.

This is the boar-bristle brush I have given her as a gift, essential for maintaining her hair.

I spoke to Kaju as I slowly brushed her hair.

 




"How's school now that you're a third-year student?"

"Since we're now in our final year and preparing for exams, the teachers are very dedicated to career guidance. We haven't really felt the pressure yet, though."

Kaju spoke up after a brief hesitation.

"Onii-sama, Kaju has decided to apply for Tsuwabuki High School."

I knew Kaju had her sights set on Tsuwabuki, but she had never stated it so clearly before. Without stopping the brush, I asked quietly.

"Have you made up your mind?"

"Yes, I've already started preparations with my teacher. Next spring, Kaju will be attending Tsuwabuki with you."

She sounded confident and strong.

"...Onii-sama, you didn't have any friends around this time last year. Kaju had hoped that I could be there with you if I got into Tsuwabuki."

-Exactly one year ago. I rarely spoke to anyone outside of necessary interactions, and even my homeroom teacher, Amanatsu-sensei, barely remembered my face.

It wasn't too uncomfortable for me, but Kaju must have been very worried.

Without realizing it, my hand had stopped moving, and Kaju placed her hand over mine.

"But now it's different. I want to go to Tsuwabuki to learn from the senpais I respect."

"...That's wonderful. If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know."

"Yes, onii-sama!"

Having declared her intentions, Kaju seemed to feel lighter. She started swinging her legs and humming a tune.

Resuming my brushing, I continued gently as if stroking her head.

*

The second day of the Golden Week five-day holiday.

Gathered in the club room are the upcoming criminals, Prez, Yanami, Shiratama-san, and me. Meanwhile, Asagumo-san, the seasoned veteran of crime, addressed us excitedly.

"Yesterday had its ups and downs, but the venue tour was a great success!"

Yanami shot a sullen look at me at those words.

"…Yeah, a lot happened. Someone here got to enjoy delicious French cuisine and had a wonderful time, it seems."

Yesterday, Shikiya-san and I left without waiting for Yanami and the others who had lost contact.

The food was delicious, and Shikiya-san smelled nice, so it was a very fulfilling day.

"We had our own issues to deal with. So, Asagumo-san, can you continue?"

"Yes. Let's organize the information from yesterday."

Asagumo-san began drawing a floor plan of the building on the whiteboard.

"Right next to the reception area is the changing room for the relatives. Passing through that leads to an open space that doubles as a guest waiting area. There's a bar counter here, so it attracts quite a bit of attention."

Switching to a red marker, she drew arrows on the not-so-great floor plan.

"Crossing the guest waiting area, you exit to the garden. Here is the chapel, but since it's outdoors and visible from the reception hall, it's difficult to move without being seen."

She drew a line from the stairs leading to the second floor towards the chapel.

"Fortunately, the path from the bridal suite on the second floor to the chapel is short. If we manage to get Tanaka-sensei out, reaching the chapel should be easy."

Prez, who had been thinking with her hand on her mouth, spoke up.

"But, crossing the guest waiting area poses a risk. Tanaka-sensei could run into someone he knows."

"Yes, I agree. So, please look at the schedule next."

With a thud, Asagumo-san slapped a printed schedule onto the whiteboard.

"The bride arrives at 7:30 AM, and the groom at 9 AM. After changing, there’s a meeting about the photo shoot and ceremony starting at 10."

She placed another paper next to it.

"At 10:30, the bus carrying the relatives arrives, and the guest reception starts at 11. The ceremony begins at 12, but there will be too many people for the plan to work by then."

Asagumo-san drew a large red X on the second sheet of paper she had just placed.

"But Tanaka-sensei arrives at 9 and meets the actual photographer an hour later, right? We barely have any time to take photos ourselves,"

Yanami said, her concern evident. Asagumo-san nodded seriously.

"Yes. The operation needs to take place between 9 and 10, specifically during the short period after Tanaka-sensei changes."

Prez smiled broadly, clearly excited.

"It's a race against time. Intriguing, isn’t it?"

Seeing everyone’s reactions, Asagumo-san began marking up the schedule with her marker.

"My rough plan is this: At 9:30, the fake photographer will call out the groom, Tanaka-sensei, under the pretext of a camera test."

Asagumo-san posted a picture of the chapel's interior on the whiteboard.

"Then, Riko-san, who will be hiding in the chapel, will appear in the photos during the test."

With a click, Asagumo-san capped the marker.

...Considering all the information we have, this seems like our only option.

In the silence that followed, Yanami took out some bread from her bag.

"It seems like we have no choice but to do it then. We need to make a detailed plan."

Mumbling while biting into a whole baguette, Yanami’s usual behavior went unnoticed by me, but the other three were staring at her.

"Hm? Why are you all looking at me like that?"

Seeing the silent trio, I decided to speak up on their behalf.

“They are wondering why you're eating a whole baguette."

"It's not fair that only Nukumizu-kun got to eat delicious French cuisine. I wanted some, too!"

So, this counts as French cuisine in Yanami's eyes. Well, she's not entirely wrong…

"No need for seasoning?"

"I did stuff it with plum jam and sweet red bean paste. I even brought some kinako as a topping- uwah, I got the salty one. Unlucky."

She continued eating unhappily. Why did she put something she doesn't like in her bread? What's with the minimal French element- these are all puzzling questions, but this is Yanami we're talking about here.

Minimizing the Yanami section of my brain, I refocused on the whiteboard.

"Let’s get back on track. What about the fake photographer? Tanaka-sensei knows our faces, and won't the venue staff catch on? They mentioned having a dedicated photographer at the information session yesterday."

Anticipating my question, Asagumo-san took out a business card.

"This is the photographer's card for onee-san's wedding. It's from Studio Damonde, not the venue's contracted studio."

Asagumo-san glanced at Shiratama-san, who continued the explanation.

"Onee-chan's friend works there, and we got special permission to use this photographer. We also have this."

Shiratama-san placed a similar-looking business card on the table.

The studio name is the same, but the photographer's name is different.

...So, these are forged business cards. I’m witnessing a crime in the making.

Asagumo-san handed the business cards to Prez after checking them.

"Hokobaru-senpai, please carry this with you on the day."

"So I'm playing as the photographer, huh?"

"Yes, senpai, and Nukumizu-san will be your assistant."

"Eh!? Me too!?"

As I expressed my surprise, Asagumo-san nodded as if it were obvious.

"Someone needs to cover Riko-san during the shoot."

"But I just attended the venue tour! They will definitely recognize me!"

Asagumo-san chuckled at my desperate resistance.

"Nukumizu-san, didn’t someone ask you for directions in front of the school gate earlier?"

"...Huh?"

Now that she mentioned it, a boy wearing a baseball cap and a mask had asked me for directions to a board game cafe this morning.

"Yeah, but what does that have to do with anything?"

"That boy was Kaju-san."

What!? No way.

"You're joking, right? The voice was definitely a boy’s."

"The initial voice you heard from behind was recorded. We pre-recorded and altered Kaju-san's voice to sound like a prepubescent boy."

"...But the rest of the conversation was live. I talked to the boy directly."

"Yes, that was Kaju-san acting. However, the impression from the first voice matters most. As long as we cut off the conversation before any inconsistency becomes apparent, the initial impression will stick."

Ehh…? Did I really mistake Kaju's voice?

I continued to resist.

"That kid had a mask, but the eyes were different. Kaju has more defined eyes."

"We used eyelid tape to make her eyes single-lidded and makeup to change her skin tone. Her hair was hidden under the baseball cap, with any stray parts concealed."

I opened my mouth to argue but found no counterargument, dropping my shoulders in defeat.

I can't believe I didn't recognize Kaju's disguise…

"Nukumizu-kun, you sure didn't recognize her despite being a siscon. Interesting."

Yanami smirked, clearly enjoying my discomfort.

"I did think something was off. But you can’t just accuse a random kid of being your sister."

"Yeah, I would have called the cops if I were there."

Exactly. It’s not surprising I didn’t recognize her, and for the record, I’m not a siscon.

Asagumo-san cleared her throat and continued her explanation.

"Tanaka-sensei knows us. However, even if he feels something's off, his initial reaction would be-"

Asagumo-san looked around at us.

"...There's no way my students would be pretending to be someone else here."

She waved the fake business card.

"This is called normalcy bias, a common psychological phenomenon. Any slight feeling of oddness won't matter with this 'Studio Damonde: Tsuguo Toratani' business card. We’ll finish everything before that discomfort turns into certainty."

I listened silently. Given that I failed to see through Kaju's disguise, I had no room to argue.

Asagumo-san's forehead sparkled again upon seeing no objection.

"Alright, now that everyone understands the plan, all of you will be in disguises this time!"

Huh!? Sorry, I don't get that part.

Representing the confused group, I hesitantly raised my hand.

"Uh, so we'll be wearing suits again, like at the venue tour?"

"No, those suits were completely unacceptable."

Asagumo-san is genuinely upset. Now I feel upset, too.

"You were guests at the venue tour, so any anomalies might have been overlooked. However, we're up against Tanaka-sensei and others this time. Any suspicion will lead to immediate reporting."

Prez raised an eyebrow as she pocketed the business card.

"This operation is time-sensitive. We won't get another chance if someone finds out."

"Exactly, we need to be perfectly prepared. I’ll handle the costumes, but let’s confirm our roles for the day."

Asagumo-san started writing on the empty space on the whiteboard.


Operation HQ: Chihaya Asagumo, Anna Yanami

Photographer: Hibari Hokobaru

Assiatant: Kazuhiko Nukumizu


I see, so on the day of the operation, Prez and I will infiltrate while Asagumo-san and the others support from outside. It’s similar to the venue tour…

Unexpected words caught my eye as I pondered about that.


Riko Shiratama: Riko Shiratama


"...? Shiratama-san is playing as herself?"

I couldn't help but interrupt, and Asagumo-san turned back with a smile.

"Yes, that's right. We need someone on the inside to guide everyone. On the day of the wedding, there’s only one person here who wouldn't look out of place at the venue."

All eyes turned to Shiratama-san, who widened her watery eyes.

"That would be me?"

"Riko-san, you’ll be supporting everyone’s movements at the venue."

I see. We need an inside supporter to escort Shiratama-san in a wedding dress to the chapel safely. She wouldn’t raise any suspicion at the venue.

"But wait, there's only one Shiratama-san."

"Then we'll just have to make another one."

Asagumo-san then added another name smoothly.


Riko Shiratama: Riko Shiratama, Kaju Nukumizu


Huh? Kaju as Shiratama-san? What?

I was too confused to speak, and Asagumo-san clapped her hands while looking at the club room door.

"Come on in, Riko-san."

The door opened, and in walked a petite girl dressed in the Tsuwabuki school uniform.

Kaju twirled in front of me.

"Ehehe, what do you think, onii-sama?"

"Uh, it looks good on you, but how are you going to pretend to be Shiratama-san?"

Asagumo-san stood beside Kaju, placing her palm on Kaju's head.

"Kaju-san is shorter than Shiratama-san, but it's easier to add height than reduce it. We’ll use shoes and a wig to adjust. Since both of them are slim, the visual adjustments should be relatively simple."

"Kaju will do her best!"

Kaju made a determined gesture with her fists. She’s cute, I admit. But…

"Please wait…"

I stood up and looked around at everyone.

"Kaju has to step down from this operation."

Ignoring Asagumo-san’s surprised expression, I continued.

"This whole thing is a problem for the Literature Club. I regret involving Prez and Asagumo-san, but Kaju isn’t a Tsuwabuki student. She's not supposed to be a part of this."

Kaju glared at me, but I met her gaze head-on.

"This is a Literature Club issue. You're going to take your entrance exam this year. Do not get yourself involved."

"But-"

Kaju started to protest, but Prez stepped in.

"Kaju-kun, your brother is right. Please leave it to us this time."

I walked over to Kaju and patted her head.

"We’re going to be at Tsuwabuki together next year, right?"

Kaju fell silent for a moment before mumbling quietly.

"...A date."

"A date?"

"Please go on a date with Kaju after everything is over."

"Ahh, yeah, sure, a date, huh?"

I nodded earnestly. Kaju raised her head and pouted.

"...All day long? From morning to night."

"Yes, I’ll do as you say."

Still looking a bit dissatisfied, Kaju finally gave in. She bowed to everyone in the room and quietly left. I'll need to make it up to her when I get home…

As I sighed quietly, Asagumo-san looked at me apologetically.

"Nukumizu-san, I’m sorry. I should’ve been more considerate. We shouldn’t have involved a middle school student like Kaju-san in this plan."

"No, I should have said something sooner. Asagumo-san-"

I was about to say it was not her fault, but I stopped. Sorry, I couldn't lie to myself.

Prez placed a hand on Asagumo-san’s shoulder, smiling wryly.

"I’m equally guilty for not realizing it. Nukumizu-kun, you’re a good onii-sama."

"No, Kaju just volunteered for it."

Yanami, having finished her baguette, clapped her hands to get rid of crumbs and tilted her head.

"But who’s going to play Shiratama-chan now that Imouto-chan's out?"

Exactly, with Kaju out, we need a replacement for the fake Shiratama-san.

Then, Asagumo-san looked intently at Yanami and spoke up.

"Yanami-san, I have a proposal."

"Yanami-san, you’re about the same height as Riko-san, right? Your leg length and face size are also similar, so you might be able to substitute for her."

"Huh? Me?"

Yanami made a confused sound while rummaging through her bag.

Yanami as a stand-in for Shiratama-san...?

"But, look, Yanami-san and Shiratama-san have different weights- body…shapes, I…mean…"

"..What exactly are you trying to say, Nukumizu-kun?"

Yanami’s piercing gaze made my words trail off.

Ignoring the awkward atmosphere, Asagumo-san cheerfully held up her phone.

"Yanami-san, Riko-san, could you both stand over there for a moment?"

"Eh? Me?"

"Yes, both of you, please."

Asagumo-san's lack of social awareness can be quite helpful in times like this.

After taking their photos, Asagumo-san booted up her laptop and turned the screen towards us.

"Please take a look, everyone."

On the screen are the full-body photos of Yanami and Shiratama-san. While their heights and proportions are similar, their silhouettes are distinctly different- like comparing items from entirely different categories in an anime shop.

Asagumo-san tapped away at the keyboard, altering Yanami's photo to make her look slimmer and Shiratama-san's photo to make her appear fuller.

"I've edited the images to bring their body types closer together. With the right clothing and wigs, we can disguise them."

"Even if you can edit the photos, we can't change reality- I mean, no offense, Yanami-san."

Why do I have to be so considerate to her?

Oblivious to my struggle, Asagumo-san pointed at the screen with a bright smile.

"This simulation shows what it would look like if Riko-san gains 2kg and Yanami-san loses the same amount by the wedding day. We just need reality to match the simulation."

Uh, so that means-

Yanami tilted her head while sucking on a small jam packet.

"I guess that means I shouldn't eat a second baguette?"

We exchanged glances and then nodded in unison, all wearing our most serious expressions of the day.

*

The third day of the five-day holiday. Five days left until the wedding.

The four criminals, Asagumo-san, Shiratama-san, Prez, and I sat in the Literature Club room.

Asagumo-san pressed the stopwatch button and stared at the numbers with slightly crossed eyes.

"1 minute and 15 seconds. Can we extend the conversation a bit more?"

"It will seem unnatural if we drag out the conversation too much. It's better to switch topics quickly to stay on time."

Prez shook her head and placed the timesheet on the table.

We are simulating the events of the big day today.

To get past the reception and extract Tanaka-sensei, we couldn’t avoid conversations. We need thorough preparation.

Asagumo-san paused while taking notes.

"...One concern is that the groom's and bride's rooms are next to each other. It could jeopardize the plan if your sister shows up."

"Onee-chan should still be in the middle of doing her makeup at that time. Plus, they have a first-look moment scheduled at the chapel, so…"

Shiratama-san said weakly, taking a bite of a whole Swiss roll.

She's working on gaining 2 kg as Yanami is going on a diet.

"Don’t overdo it. It’s not worth risking your health."

"Everyone’s doing their best. I want to do my part too."

Shiratama-san said tearfully, taking another bite, though the Swiss roll didn’t seem to get any smaller. Yanami is quite something else, indeed…

The clubroom door creaked open as I reevaluated my opinion of Yanami.

"I-I need a quick break…"

In came Yanami in a tracksuit, having been out running for her diet.

As she plopped down on a chair and tried to open a bottle, Asagumo-san immediately snatched it from her.

"Asagumo-chan?"

"This has too much sugar. I made a low-calorie drink for you. Please drink this." 

Asagumo-san said, handing her a thermos.

"What’s in it?"

"...It will help you lose weight."

"Say no more!"

Yanami gulped down the contents of the thermos. Is it safe to drink something like that so quickly?

Asagumo-san handed me the stopwatch while I watched anxiously.

"Alright, let’s run through the conversation simulation and tighten up the timetable. Nukumizu-san, can you time it for us?"

"Ahh, yeah."

Prez Hokobaru will handle most of the day's Conversations. However, I need to coordinate with Shiratama-san, who will be infiltrating the chapel, so I have to stay alert to both tasks.

After completing a full simulation from entry to exit, I noticed Yanami staring blankly into space with empty eyes.

"Are you okay? You're not dehydrated, right?"

"Hey, what does it mean to eat...?"

She started saying strange things, different from her usual self.

"You're not okay. Should I go buy some rice balls or something?"

Yanami shook her head slowly.

"What is appetite…? Why do people die when you take away their lives…?"

She then took another sip of the Asagumo drink. That thing is probably too advanced for humanity, right?

Still, sacrifices must be made for the greater good…

As I rationalized this to myself, Yanami slowly stood up.

"Alright, I think I'll go for another run."

"Please rest for a bit more."

"I have a feeling I can do it. I can even run all the way to America."

That’s definitely just a feeling, but I shouldn’t dampen her motivation. I smiled and saw her off.

"...Asagumo-san, that drink- is it really safe? It's legal, right?"

"Yes, it's perfectly legal. I researched all the relevant laws."

I picked up my half-finished mug- didn’t drink from it, and set it back down on the table.

…I'll definitely delete Asagumo-san's contact info from Kaju's phone when I get home. I vowed to myself.

*

After finishing the meeting in the clubroom, I found myself at the east exit of Toyohashi Station.

I stopped by on my way home to visit the bookstore and anime shop in the station building.

As I looked at a poster for an event on the wall, I decided to change my path and head towards the South Plaza. I couldn’t explain why. It was just a whim.

Had I stuck to my original plan and gone to the bookstore, I wouldn't have run into Yanami, who was pressing herself against the glass of a standing udon shop, watching the people inside.

She's watching the diners while eating a banana.

…She's a step away from being suspicious. I really don't want to do this, but I guess I should say something.

"Yanami-san, what are you doing?"

"Oh, Nukumizu-kun."

Yanami glanced at me and took another bite of her banana.

"I realized I was acting a bit weird earlier. I wanted to calm down a bit."

Good, she’s finally back to her senses. Not that her normal state is particularly sane…

"So you’re taking a break here?"

"Yeah, I'm eating air udon."

...Huh? Maybe she's still a bit off.

Yanami gave me a sharp look.

"If you want to lose weight quickly, you have to restrict your diet, right? I’ve only had a banana since this morning."

"So, eating a banana while standing here is your air udon…?"

"Exactly. Eating a banana while watching people eat udon is like eating udon myself, right? It nourishes both my body and soul."

"Did it nourish your soul?"

"...No."

Then you're just being a weirdo.

But Yanami is genuinely trying to lose weight this time. Her so-called diets usually involve bizarre behaviors, but now she's seriously dieting.

"Are you sure it’s okay to cut back on your meals suddenly? I mean, health-wise."

"Don’t worry. I always eat properly to prepare for times like this."

I see, so she has already prepared her body for this.

"Well, I guess I have to show my senpai-like qualities at least a little."

"I'm surprised. Yanami-san. You're actually concerned about Shiratama-san."

"Of course. Who knows what she'll do if we leave her alone? It's the best we can do if taking a photo is all she wants."

...I can’t argue with that. Yanami finished her banana and swung the peel around.

"Besides, when I look at her, it's like looking at myself a year ago, and I can’t just ignore that."

"Speaking of a year ago-"

Everything changed when Himemiya-san transferred to our class.

Yanami has realized she's not Sosuke Hakamada's heroine anymore. She's just his Friend A.

"Things might have been different if I was as reckless as her."

Yanami reminisced about a time when Shiratama’s recklessness would have seemed like desperation to her. She wouldn’t have been able to go that far a year ago.

Now, though, Yanami could understand.

"I get it now. I knew confessing to Sosuke would result in rejection, so I couldn’t take the step. I just tried to keep things the same."

Yanami’s smile carried a hint of self-mockery.

"Don’t get me wrong. I’m content with it and don’t have any regrets."

"Yeah, I get it."

We might be having a serious conversation, but we still look like a bunch of freaks watching strangers eat udon.

I took a plastic bag from my backpack and collected Yanami's finished banana peel.

"How about we go for ramen after this is all over? My treat."

"...Sure. But, Nukumizu-kun, are you trying to make me gain weight?"

"That would just mean you're going back to your usual self, right?"

"Hmph, I'll show you my true power then. Prepare yourself."

She then smiled mischievously.

I smiled awkwardly, already regretting my offer.

Yanami's true power, huh? I might need to withdraw some savings.

The next afternoon, on the fourth day of the five-day holiday, I stood leaning against the wall in the hallway outside the clubroom next to Prez.

On the door in front of us hung a sign reading <Changing! No boys allowed!>

We're waiting for Yanami and Shiratama-san to come out. Prez offered me a small bag of fruit gummies.

"Nukumizu-kun, want some?"

"Ah, yes. Thank you."

I took a gummy from the bag and popped it into my mouth, savoring the sweet and tangy mandarin flavor.

...I didn’t expect her to carry snacks like this around.

Prez gave a wry smile as I pondered.

"Snacks don’t really fit my image, do they?"

"No, it's just surprising. I always thought of you as more serious, with a sense of self-restraint."

"I actually struggle to gain weight, so I don't restrict my snacking."

Prez said this as she popped a gummy into her mouth.

Right, there are girls like that, just like Shiratama-san.

Staying with Yanami for too long really shatters your common sense. I should be careful…

"No, well, what I find surprising is this whole situation."

"What do you mean?"

"Yes. I never expected Prez to get involved in something like this."

"I did tell you, didn’t I? I've experienced the agony of a love I couldn’t speak of as well."

Prez gave me a piercing look.

"Do I look like I'm uninterested in love?"

"Eh? No…"

Prez chuckled at my flustered expression.

"I’m a girl just like any other. I have dreams of marriage and wearing a wedding dress. Do you think it wouldn’t suit me?"

"No, I don’t think that at all."

The conversation lulled for a moment as we both stared at the "No Boys Allowed" sign on the door.

Come to think of it, shouldn’t she be allowed inside...?

Just as I was about to voice this thought, the club room door slowly opened.

Yanami peeked out from the gap.

"Sorry to keep you two waiting. Please come in."

Finally, they are done changing. Prez and I stepped into the club room…

"Ta-da! Presenting Shiratama-chan in her wedding dress!"

Yanami's loud announcement slightly diminished the impact, but there stands Shiratama-san, wearing a beautiful white wedding dress.

The dress features lace embellishments around the shoulders and neckline, and the skirt flares out gracefully but is much shorter than typical designs.

The front hemline reaches mid-thigh, while the back extends to the middle of her calves. She wears low-heeled white shoes, probably for ease of movement.

She looks like a delicate fairy- though I stopped myself from saying that out loud, realizing how disgusting it sounded.

"So, how do I look...?"

Her hesitant, anxious look is incredibly cute.

Prez spoke up with an impressed look while I was mentally searching for less cringeworthy words.

"My my, you look absolutely lovely. I almost want to whisk you away somewhere."

I'd probably get sent to the shadow realm had I said that.

But it was none other than Hibari Hokobaru who said it. Shiratama-san blushed, her shy smile widening. For some reason, Yanami looked proud, puffing out her chest with a smug expression.

"I did the makeup, and it turned out great. Shiratama-chan's skin is so smooth and clear. It was fun to work on. Ah, such…youth…"

Have more confidence, Yanami. You're not lacking youth yourself.

While I encouraged her silently, Prez nodded with a serious expression.

"All preparations are complete. Is the final version of the plan ready?"

"Yes, Asagumo-san will bring it to the clubroom after school tomorrow. SC Prez, could you join us then?"

"Of course. It would be lonely to be left out at this point."

...Finally, we've made it this far. We’ve spent the entire Golden Week preparing for this.

Luckily, we still have one more day left in the holiday. Tomorrow, I’ll relax at home with some light novels.

Asagumo-san entered the club room as I etched the image of the cute Shiratama-san in my mind.

"Ara, Riko-san, you look wonderful. Everyone, can I have a moment?"

After giving a quick compliment, Asagumo-san spread a map on the table.

"We planned to change in the Literature Club room and take a taxi to the venue. However, the round trip seems to make the schedule quite tight."

She continued without waiting for us to lean in.

"It would be ideal if we had a room nearby. A hotel or rental room would be perfect, but there’s nothing suitable in the area."

"I might have an idea in that case."

Yanami said, tapping her finger on the map. It's Kirinoki High School, right next to the venue.

"A friend of mine is in the Drama Club at Kirinoki High. I could ask if we can use their clubroom. We might also be able to borrow any missing costumes."

"That would be nice, but can outsiders like us be coming and going like that?"

Prez smiled reassuringly.

"We can frame it as a Literature Club research project. I know a teacher at Kirinoki, so I'll smooth things over."

These two are quick to act. This is the power of social skills…

I felt a tug on my sleeve as I watched them start making phone calls. It's Shiratama-san.

"I still haven't heard your thoughts, Prez."

Of course, she looks absolutely adorable, but saying that outright would be inappropriate.

If I were to compare her to a fairy, an angel, or a kitten- it’s not sexual harassment, but it’s certainly creepy.

"...Uh, the color of the dress matches you…really well. It emphasizes your natural charm, which evokes a refreshing sense of joy in the viewer."

Good, I’ve chosen a compliment that’s appropriate and devoid of creepiness.

Shiratama-san tilted her head cutely.

"In one word?"

"Uh, I think you look good."

Shiratama-san giggled and took a selfie with her phone.

...I was completely cornered into saying that.

Yanami finished her call and gave me a sharp look.

"We can use the Drama Club’s room. Now, it’s time to change, so all the guys need to leave!"

"Ah, yeah- come to think of it, Prez doesn't need to leave the room, right?"

I caught Yanami's gaze as I left the room. She mouthed silently, but I could clearly understand.

What she said was…that's…why…I…don't…like…this…part…of…you.

*

The next day, the final day of Golden Week.

Our group of five criminals stood outside Kirinoki High School, a 15-minute bike ride from Tsuwabuki.

All first-year students in this school take commerce classes and then specialize in fields like accounting or information technology in their second year.

IT sounds cool, but after clicking a suspicious banner and completely destroying my home computer, I decided to leave it to the experts.

There are still students in clubs even though it's a holiday. I feel kind of out of place…

Prez tapped my shoulder as I fidgeted and stared at the statue of Hermes in front of the school building.

"I’m going to the staff room to greet them. You guys head to the Drama Club room."

Prez carried a paper bag filled with rice crackers and headed towards the school building.

"Yanami-san, where do we go?"

"It’s on the first floor of the practice building at the back. The Drama Club uses an empty classroom there, and we can use it."

Yanami looked around, checking her smartphone for directions.

Asagumo-san walked around before waving at us.

"Follow me. This way."

Her curiosity was barely concealed as she quickly started walking.

Yanami and Shiratama-san walked side by side, so I followed them.

"Are you close with your friend in the Drama Club?"

"Yeah, she's my food tour buddy. I traded my handmade ramen shop map for permission to use their club room."

I can faintly hear their conversation.

...A food tour buddy with Yanami? She must be a good person. I would never be able to handle that.

While I was lost in thought, we arrived at a three-story, old-school building.

Without hesitation, Yanami and the others entered, leaving me to follow reluctantly.

On the dimly lit first floor, we found a classroom with a sign that read "Drama Club".

"Okay, I'll knock-"

"Excuse us!"

Yanami cheerfully opened the door without waiting. Have some manners, will you?

The first thing I noticed was the smell of paint and dust wafting from the room.

The large classroom has been repurposed into a storage area for the Drama Club, with plywood sets lined up against the walls and boxes of props scattered around. There are enough costumes hanging on racks to last a lifetime.

At the back of the room, a girl sitting on a sofa yawned and slowly stood up.

"Oh, Yanamin, long time no see. Did you eat today?"

"Long time no see, Nina! I'm on a diet right now." 

Nina (?) looks thoroughly Japanese despite the foreign-sounding name.

She has sleepy eyes and a simple, unassuming demeanor.

I decided to introduce myself as their greeting ended.

"...Uh, I’m Nukumizu from Tsuwabuki High’s Literature Club. Thank you for letting us use your club room-"

"Nukumizu-san? So, you're the guy, huh?"

She seems to be staring at me, like really hard.

"Hey…"

"Oh, sorry. I'm Niina, the Drama Club's vice president. 'Nii' for fresh and 'na' for vegetables." [TL: Nii (新, fresh or new) + na (菜, vegetables).]

Nina- now identified as Niina-san, the Drama Club's vice president, extended her hand toward me.

…Uh, is it okay to shake hands with a girl I've just met?

As I glanced at Yanami and shook Niina-san's hand, I realized there was something hard in her palm.

"...A key?"

"It's the key to this room. We usually practice in the gym, so we only use this room for changing and storing our stuff."

Niina-san looked between me and Yanami one last time-

"Well, good luck, Yanamin."

She said that and left the room. How come Niina-san seems like a genuinely nice person despite being connected to Yanami?

While I was feeling pleasantly surprised, Yanami nudged my arm with her elbow.

"See? She’s a good girl, right? You can tell because her name has the same 'na' as mine."

She spoke with pride, but her gaze was fixed on the floor.

"What's wrong, Yanami-san?"

"...There’s some leftover candy on the floor. Do you think it’s still okay to eat?"

"Give up. You're supposed to lose 2 kg before the wedding, remember?"

I picked up the empty box from the floor and looked around for a trash can.

Despite the room's somewhat cluttered appearance, it's clearly well-organized, and the schedule on the blackboard looks new.

It is evident that this is a legitimate Drama Club room.

As I surveyed the room, Asagumo-san, who had been tinkering with a laptop on the floor next to Shiratama-san, suddenly muttered.

"Everything looks good. The surrounding signals are clear."

"Uh, Asagumo-san, what have you been doing?"

"This room will be our base of operation for the day. I need to check a few things."

Asagumo-san stood up energetically, her forehead gleaming with enthusiasm.

"Come on, Riko-san, let's go find the best signal spots. You need to become one with the Bluetooth signal!"

"Uh, okay! I’m not sure what that means, but I’ll try my best!"

Asagumo-san dashed out of the room, with Shiratama-san following, holding an antenna.

I really hope she doesn’t teach our rookie too many strange things…

And Yanami, stop eyeing the trash can so intently.

*

With my smartphone's map in hand, I walked behind the Drama Club's room, exploring the surrounding area.

I need to familiarize myself with the terrain for the big day.

With Yanami off on a jog, I found myself alone and feeling a bit uneasy.

The drama club room is located on the northern side of the practice building, bordering the edge of Kirinoki High School's grounds. Beyond the fence lies a residential area.

As I walked west along the fence, I noticed a tall hedge blocking my path at the end. The other side of the hedge is right next to the entrance of the wedding venue, but it doesn’t seem like I can pass through-

"Huh…?"

Lifting my gaze from the smartphone map, I was startled by what I saw.

A hole large enough for a person to crawl through has been cut into the hedge, which stands over 2 meters tall. It seems too convenient to be a coincidence…

"Nukumizu-san, are you scouting the area too?"

I turned at the sound of the voice to find Asagumo-san and Shiratama-san approaching.

Both of them had leaves stuck to their heads and clothes. Did you two…?

"…Asagumo-san, you didn’t happen to make that hole in the hedge, did you?"

"Hole? Ara, there’s a hole here?"

Asagumo-san gave a surprised expression as if noticing the hole for the first time.

"So, you’re saying this is just a coincidence?"

"Yes, of course, it’s a coincidence. Right, Riko-san?"

"Yes, a total coincidence, Asagumo-senpai."

Shiratama-san’s smile was flawless, leaving no room for doubt. The verdict is 2-1. It’s decided- it’s a coincidence. Yup, it's definitely a coincidence.

That said, once this operation is over, I’m considering banning Asagumo-san from the Literature Club. Footsteps approached from behind as I mentally tallied Asagumo-san's crimes.

Startled, I quickly turned around to see Prez.

I instinctively shifted to block the hole in the hedge with my body.

"There you three are. I got caught up talking to a teacher I know."

Prez came over and raised a sheet of paper before us.

"We got permission to enter and exit under the pretext of a research project. Now we can move freely."

Upon hearing this, Asagumo-san clapped her hands together in delight.

"That means our activities are now officially legal!"

"We did it, Asagumo-senpai!"

…No, this is still illegal.

Watching the two of them celebrating together, I could only muster a weak smile.

*

It's now past 5 PM, and the sky is beginning to darken.

After finishing our reconnaissance at Kirinoki High School, I stopped by Tsuwabuki again.

I came here to borrow the next volume of <She Might Be My Imaginary Girlfriend>.

It's a romantic comedy about a girl whom only the protagonist can see. I had hesitated to read it back when the next volume caused a huge controversy upon release, but now I feel ready to dive in-

Filled with anticipation, I opened the door to the Literature Club room, expecting it to be empty, but someone was already there, to my surprise.

It's Shiratama-san. She's holding several small white flowers, carefully wrapping them with wire.

"Oh, you're here."

“Yes, I thought I would finish this bouquet. I can't take it home, after all."

I grabbed the next volume from the bookshelf and, after a moment’s hesitation, sat down in the chair opposite her.

The small flowers are artificial. She meticulously arranged them to create a beautiful curve, carefully wrapping the stems with tape.

After a while, she seemed satisfied with the shape. She squeezed the rounded part of the bouquet, repeating it a few times.

"Look, the flowers spread out when you release this part. It’s compact so that I can hide it under my clothes."

"Wow, that’s impressive."

Shiratama-san smiled as she began the final touch, adding a decorative ribbon.

"...Don’t worry."

She murmured quietly, her eyes focused on her work.

"Huh? About what?"

"I’ll take responsibility and make sure no one else gets in trouble if it comes down to it. So please, don’t worry about that."

She fell silent after saying this.

Watching her hunched over as she crafted the bouquet, I couldn’t help but speak up.

"...Shiratama-san, you mentioned you had nothing to lose the other day."

This is likely none of my business.

It’s not like she was looking for advice, and my words might not even help.

"But maybe you just don’t realize it yet. You might already have something important."

Her hands froze.

"...Once it’s gone, it’s too late. So, just take care of yourself and the things you have, even if it’s just a little."

Shiratama-san, who had been silently listening, finally spoke, her gaze still lowered.

"...Did something happen to you, Prez?"

"Nothing worth bringing up."

I shifted my gaze to the bookshelf against the wall, recalling last summer. Just before I realized I was friends with Yanami.

The memory of rejecting and hurting Yanami came flooding back.

Yanami, standing before that bookshelf, looked at me like I was a stranger. Even after a year, I still vividly remember that day.

"Everything comes to an end eventually, but how it ends and how you choose to remember it- Shiratama-san, you still have the power to decide that. So please, don’t let yourself become desperate."

Shiratama-san resumed her work, her hands moving steadily.

"...But there are things you just want to let go of."

"There are things that become too painful to hold onto, things you want to throw away. Even memories can be one of those."

Letting go. Letting go of everything. But what lies at the end of such a path?

I don’t know what that place looks like, but I have a feeling that the person who reaches it won’t be smiling.

"Even so-"

"I'm done!"

She cut off my words, holding up the finished bouquet to her chest with a teasing glint in her eyes.

"Ehehe, is it cute?"

"...Yeah, it's really beautiful."

The words slipped out naturally.

Her bravado, her lies, and the loneliness she couldn’t fully hide.

Faced with all that, I could only respond with simple, honest words, like a fool.

Shiratama-san looked surprised at my response but then quietly smiled.


"...Thank you."


But her smile reminded me so much of Yanami’s expression from that day.

My chest tightened.



Intermission: Other People's Secrets Are Sweet as Honey


One evening, in a cozy apartment, three women gathered around a low table.

When Konami Amanatsu, the host, raised her glass, the other two, Sayo Konuki and Minori Shiratama, followed suit.

"Alright, here’s to Minori Shiratama’s upcoming wedding! Cheers!"

"Cheers!" (x2)

Their glasses clinked together with a resounding note, and Amanatsu downed her beer in one go, placing the empty glass back on the table.

"This is great news! Tanaka-sensei is well-liked by both his students and colleagues. You really found yourself a good one, Noritama-chan."

"Yes, I really am lucky."

Minori agreed with a bright smile, pouring more beer into Amanatsu’s glass.

Konuki looked up at the ceiling, counting on her fingers.

"You’ve been together for seven years since university, right? Even if you decided to get married, it sure took a long time."

"He wanted me to focus on settling into my job first. He said the first three years are crucial."

She couldn’t hide the grin spreading across her face. Amanatsu and Konuki exchanged amused, knowing glances.

"Come to think of it, you never introduced him to us during college, no matter how much we asked. It wasn’t until he started teaching at Tsuwabuki that we finally saw his face."

"That’s right. Why did you keep him a secret?"

Minori held her glass with both hands and smiled sweetly.


"-Because your type is always someone else's boyfriend, Nuki-san."


Amanatsu’s chopsticks slipped, dropping a scallop onto the table.

"Noritama-chan, you’re too blunt. Besides, Konuki-chan’s settled down a lot recently."

"Ara, Minori’s right. You know how tempting other people’s things can be."

"...Konuki-chan, at least try to deny it a little."

Konami Amanatsu, 28 years old, found herself playing the role of the straight woman in this trio, something that rarely happened.

As Konuki and Minori toasted once more, Amanatsu chewed on her scallop, feeling slightly exasperated.

"The wedding is this weekend, right? Are you all set?"

"Yes, everything is…ready."

There was something in Minori’s tone that gave her words a vague undertone, prompting Konuki to look at her with concern.

"Is it about Riko-chan?"

Minori tried to smile but quickly gave up and nodded.

"We haven't been able to talk much ever since that incident."

"Riko is really attached to you, after all. She probably feels like Tanaka-sensei is taking you away from her, so she can't fully celebrate your wedding."

Amanatsu said casually, softening Minori's tense expression.

"Maybe. And she got herself a boyfriend recently."

"Really? Who's the guy?"

"She said he's the president of the Literature Club."

Ahem! Konuki and Amanatsu nearly choked because of the shock.

They exchanged glances, carefully choosing their words before speaking.

"...Uh, well, he's not very…noticeable, but he's not a bad person. He does have a bunch of girls around him, though."

"True. The fact that he can stay calm while surrounded by so many girls shows promise. He's quite the catch."

"What kind of kid is he…?"

Minori’s face filled with worry at her friends' words.

"...Well, he has a similar vibe to Tanaka-sensei."

Amanatsu added, trying to find something positive to say. Minori straightened up at this.

"...So, Riko chose someone who resembles Yuji-san."

Minori said it to herself as if it were a confirmation before returning to her usual composed smile.

"Oh, by the way, Amanatsu-san, didn’t you start using a dating app? Have you met anyone interesting?"

"Yes, didn't you say you had a meeting arranged?"

"...I almost got roped into buying an apartment."

"............" (x2)

With a snap, Amanatsu opened another beer, not bothering to pour it into a glass before taking a long swig.

Konuki held up her beer can toward Minori, who silently offered her the glass for a refill.


"Drink up, Konami."

"Absolutely, let’s keep it coming."

"Yeah, let's go all out tonight!"


A breeze from the window gently billowed the curtains.

The night air is already tinged with the scent of early summer-
